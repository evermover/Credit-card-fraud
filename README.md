# Credit-card-fraud

This project uses logistic regression to detect credit card fraud. The dataset contains information about credit card transactions, including the amount of the transaction, the time of the transaction, and the location of the transaction. The logistic regression model is trained on a subset of the data that is known to be fraudulent. The model is then used to predict whether new transactions are fraudulent or not.

## Dataset
We used the data from kaggle. To download the dataset Click Here<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud>.

## Output
The output will be a list of transactions, along with the predicted probability that each transaction is fraudulent.

## Limitations:
The system is limited by the quality of the dataset. The dataset is constantly being updated, so the accuracy of the model may change over time. Additionally, the system is only as good as the features that are included in the dataset. If important features are not included in the dataset, the model may not be able to accurately detect fraud.

## Future work:
The system could be improved by using a more comprehensive dataset of credit card transactions. Additionally, the system could be improved by using a more sophisticated fraud detection algorithm.
